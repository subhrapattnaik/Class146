# PRO-C146

\
We can use the animation component in A-Frame for orbiting planets around the sun.
\
We can mention the “property” we want to animate and set different attributes for that property such as “from”, “to”, “dur”, “easing”, “loop” etc. ,to animate the entity.
\
property: Property to animate, it can be component name, property of any component,or just an attribute.
\
from: The initial value of the property, if not specified the current property value of the entity will be used.
\
to: The final/target value of the property at the end of animation.
\
dur: Duration of the animation cycle i.e. for how long each animation will be executed. The duration is
mentioned in milliseconds. Default value is 1000 milliseconds(1 sec= 1000 milliseconds).
\
easing: It is a timing function, which can be used to change the animation speed per animation cycle. Default value is “easeInQuad”.
\
loop: How many loops(number) i.e. many times the animation should repeat. If the value is true, the animation will repeat infinitely.
